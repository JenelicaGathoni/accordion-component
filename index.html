        <div class="label">
            What are my plans for the future?
        </div>
        <div class="content ">
           honestly speaking I am one of those people who like to sit back and let life playout.I mean sometimes we just have to let go and let God do His thing.I feel like sometimes we limit God by dreaming small. I feel like if we let him he is able to surprise us in wats we could never have imagined.

            Where do i see myself in 10 years?
        </div>
        <div class="content ">
            I really don't know but sometimes I just like to lie on my bed and think of a life in a big house with a basement where I have this secret computer lab, carrying out some secret mission to change humanity.I don't know what I will be doing but you can't join the dots from forwards.Who knows maybe one day I will look back and be like "Wow this happened."

           What do I do in my free time?

        <div class="content ">
           Okay, a few months back I used to sit in the house and watch TV all day long .Right now I enjoy taking walks in the evening after a long coding day.I actually feel like coding has somehow become my new hobby so most times I somehow feel like just sittin and writing code.
